      'was created to help 911 work better in Central Falls by educating residents on differences between emergency vs. non-emergency needs, while informing them of health care resources available in the city. It encourages proactive behavior, such as using Express Care Centers or scheduling regular check-ups with a family doctor, in hopes of addressing health care needs for individuals—and the community as a whole—before they require emergency care.',

      'Unnecessary 911 calls in the Central Falls community can stretch City resources and potentially compromise quality emergency care for those who truly need it. When individuals embrace Care Before the Call™ and become active participants in their personal health using available resources, such as family doctors at the Blackstone Valley Neighborhood Health Station, we hope to reduce the number of unnecessary 911 calls in the City of Central Falls as we work towards becoming the healthiest community in Rhode Island.',
