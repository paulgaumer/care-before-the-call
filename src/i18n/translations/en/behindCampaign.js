        'Mayor James A. Diossa was born and raised in Central Falls of immigrant parents from Colombia. Concerned by the direction his city was heading in, due to in part by the fact that many young people were leaving their city in search of better opportunities elsewhere, James decided to get involved in the wellbeing of the city. He was elected to city council in 2009 and Mayor of Central Falls in 2012. He believes that the five targets of priority in the city are education, public safety/health, financial stability/governmental transparency, infrastructure, and community investment. Mayor Diossa believes the Care Before the Call initiative, which focuses on promoting that residents visit primary care physicians or family doctors, is extremely important to keep the residents of Central Falls healthy.',
